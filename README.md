## What Bloomy Is

Bloomy helps you learn to write **reasoned code**.

Not by handing you solutions.
Not by making you watch endless tutorials.

But by teaching you how to:
- think like a programmer
- translate ideas into logic
- and then write the code yourself

## What is Reasoned Code?

Reasoned code is code you can:

- explain line by line
- defend in a conversation
- adapt when requirements change

It’s written from understanding - not memorization, copy-paste, or black-box AI output.

## What Bloomy Supports (MVP)

Bloomy is being built to support learners who want to build real projects in:

- Web development
- Data analysis
- Machine learning

The focus is not on covering everything -  
but on helping you **understand what you build**.

This repository currently hosts Bloomy’s public landing page and waitlist.

The core product is under active development.

## Built With Learners

Bloomy is shaped in collaboration with educators, researchers,
and early learners who want to build real things.

If you're interested in:
- learning by building
- understanding code instead of copying it
- helping shape how Bloomy works

You’re invited to be part of this journey.
