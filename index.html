    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section class="problem">
      <p class="lead">Right now, if you want to build something but don't know how to code, you have two options:</p>
      
      <div class="options">
        <div class="option bad">
          <span class="icon">❌</span>
          <h3>Use AI tools</h3>
          <p>Get code you don't understand. No learning happens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="option bad">
          <span class="icon">❌</span>
          <h3>Take a course</h3>
          <p>Spend months on theory. 90% give up before building anything real.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="insight">Both miss the point: <strong>you need to learn how programmers think, not just what the syntax looks like.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <!-- SOLUTION -->
    <section class="solution">
      <h2>Bloomy teaches you to think first, then code.</h2>
      
      <div class="steps">
        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">1</div>
          <h3>Think</h3>
          <p>Describe what you want to build in plain language. No code yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-arrow">→</div>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">2</div>
          <h3>Translate</h3>
          <p>See how your thinking maps to programming logic and syntax.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-arrow">→</div>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">3</div>
          <h3>Build</h3>
          <p>Write the code yourself with guided prompts. Understand every line.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="outcome">You don't just get working code. You learn why it works.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- DIFFERENCE -->
    <section class="difference">
      <h2>Why this works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No syntax overload.</strong> You learn the mental model before touching code.</li>
        <li><strong>No black boxes.</strong> You write every line yourself — AI just guides you.</li>
        <li><strong>No wasted time.</strong> Build real projects from day one, not after months of theory.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
